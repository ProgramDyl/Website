                    I have always had an interest in having fun. Enjoying<br>myself at all times has been my obsession for as long as I<br>can remember. Being creative and feeling free is usually a<br>cheatcode for enjoying myself. When I was very young, I would<br>draw cartoon characters and give them voices. I made short comic strips,<br>and was constantly trying to make people around me laugh.<br><br><br> A little later, after my Mom tried (and soon put down) the guitar, I decided I would<br>try it out. This was a moment that would eventually lead me to Berklee<br>College of Music for guitar. I had private instruction under Tomo<br>Fujita (James Valentine, John Mayer), and gained so much perspective<br> of perspective and life experience. While there I made lifelong<br>friendships.<br><br><br>My interest in technology and problem-solving has been<br>a constant in my life. I've an avid video-game player and, as with<br>all my hobbies, I need to know *everything* about it. Basically<br>programming, to me, is an artform and I am so<br>excited to continue my journey.<br><br><br>
