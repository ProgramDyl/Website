# DylanCDev 

Hello! I am a programming student in Nova Scotia, Canada. I am creating a website I can show to potential employers, collaborators, and clients. This site began 
as a final project for an 'Introduction to Web Development' course. I had so much fun putting it together I decided to just keep going! So as I continue to learn
more about programming and web development, I will be implement this knowledge into this website as much as possible. So keep checking back to see the progress. 
For any developers who want to help, I am still learning GitHub and am looking to fork it for anyone to give some input. Thanks! ðŸš€

## Description

It's very basically put together generally. There's an index page that links to: 'Resume', 'Skills', 'Contact', 'About Me'. 
Eventually I would like each page to be it's own beautifully rendered page and I am not terribly far off (from having 
separate pages that is lol). 
The CSS is messy and divided into 2 media queries: desktop/mobile. More responsivity is a welcome help from others. 

Any advice is welcome! 


### Dependencies

* An IDE (I'm using VSCode) 
* Chrome Dev Tools
* No special dependencies
  
## Help

I am not using efficient CSS rules to keep my divs clean on the index page. I need to clean up the 'social media' section in particular. Any 
help would be appreciated. Feel free to fork it and mess around with what is there if you are so inclined.
